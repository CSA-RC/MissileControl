Missile Control is a remake of Missile Command, a classic Atari game where
you shoot down falling bombs with your own missiles to stop them from destroying your cities.
This version (so far) is infinite and has no penalty for not stopping the missiles, but when you
shoot a rocket, you lose 10 points. You get 25 points for each missile you hit. To play, use the
mouse to aim at the missiles. The rockets will fly towards the point you clicked and expand
in an explosion. If a bomb hits the explosion, it will also explode.
